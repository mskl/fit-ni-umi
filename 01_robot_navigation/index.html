        This interactive visualization was made with D3.js to visualize the shortest path of a robot going through a maze
        that contains rectangular shapes. I wanted to improve my D3 javascript skills while also solving a class assignment
        for the artificial intelligence course (UMI). The frontend part took a lot of work but I feel like I learned
        a lot by doing so.

        Robot tries to find the shortest path between the green dot (beginning) and red dot (end) nodes. When a new
        rectangle is added, we first remove all connections that intersect the newly created rectangle, we update
        the underlying graph structure and then by using a Djiskra search algorithm we find the shortest path from
        the beginning to the end. The shortest path is visualized by green color.

        This visualization could be easily extended to support polygons and other robot movement constrains.
